# Jeremiasz Mozgwa thesis 2021
This is the second attempt on my thesis app using javascript instead of C#.

### If you dont have node on your pc follow these instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## How to run the app:
### Backend: 
1. In your console goto /backend
2. npm install (ignore potential package manager errors)
3. npm start
### Frontend:
1. In a seperate console goto /frontend
2. npm install (ignore potential package manager errors)
3. npm start

Your browser should open with the page loading. Wait for the bundler to finish building.
# LOGIN: test, PW: test

## Aplication fatures:
- full login authentication and authorisation via browser session
- you can pick and edit image before sending it for processing to backend
- you can browse through saved images
- you can delete processed images

## Used technologies:
### Backend:
- Express.js https://expressjs.com/ - lightweight and super fast
- JIMP https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimpfor image processing
### Frontend:
- React https://reactjs.org/ clientside logic and processing

Both fronend and backend is pure javascript.
